# Pokemon-Analysis
Showing the power of Python with the analysis of my favorite animated series.

The world of Pokemon is a beloved franchise from Japan that has millions of fans worldwide. In this notebook, we will analyze and explore datasets containing information about various Pokemon species. Through data analysis, we aim to gain insights into different aspects of Pokemon, such as their types, abilities, and more. This project will showcase the power of Python as a tool for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization.
